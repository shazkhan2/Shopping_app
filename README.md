## $\textcolor{Cyan}{Shopping\ App\}$

This repository hosts a $\color{green}{React\ based,}$ shopping application where users can browse items and manage their shopping selections. It is created in $\color{red}{TypeScript,}$
and leverages $\color{blue}{React\ Context\ API}$ for state management, ensuring a seamless experience for managing cart items and their quantities. The app includes features like dynamically updating totals, adding and removing items from the cart, and intuitive UI components for a smooth shopping experience. 

Instead of Create React App, I experimented with creating it in Vite. Vite provides significantly faster development server startup times.

**Store Item Component**: Displays individual items with options to add to and remove from cart.

**Shopping Cart Component**: Manages cart items, quantities, and total cost dynamically.

**Responsive Design**: I am working on it to ensures usability across various devices with adaptive layouts.
